{2860}{2912}- Captain.|- Yes, sir?|
{2915}{2966}Tell them we wish|to board at once.|
{3002}{3036}With all due respect...|
{3039}{3116}the ambassadors for the supreme|chancellor wish to board immediately.|
{3119}{3164}<i>Yes, of course.</i>|
{3167}{3241}<i>As you know,|our blockade is perfectly legal...</i>|
{3244}{3342}<i>and we'd be happy|to receive the ambassadors.</i>|
{3881}{3944}I'm TC-14 at your service.|
{3947}{3992}This way, please.|
{4139}{4212}We are greatly honoured|by your visit, Ambassadors.|
{4215}{4260}Make yourselves comfortable.|
{4263}{4319}My master|will be with you shortly.|
{4412}{4467}I have a bad feeling about this.|
{4470}{4542}- I don't sense anything.|- It's not about the mission, Master.|
{4545}{4639}It's something elsewhere, elusive.|
{4642}{4699}Don't centre on your anxieties,|Obi-Wan.|
{4702}{4777}Keep your concentration here and now,|where it belongs.|
{4780}{4848}But Master Yoda said|I should be mindful of the future.|
{4851}{4899}But not at the expense|of the moment.|
{4902}{4972}Be mindful of the living Force,|young Padawan.|
{4975}{5021}Yes, Master.|
{5074}{5161}How do you think this trade viceroy|will deal with the chancellor's demands?|
{5164}{5215}These Federation types are cowards.|
{5218}{5286}The negotiations will be short.|
{5307}{5368}What? What did you say?|
{5371}{5442}The ambassadors are Jedi knights,|I believe.|
{5460}{5489}I knew it.|
{5492}{5546}They're here to force a settlement.|
{5578}{5652}Distract them.|I will contact Lord Sidious.|
{5655}{5693}Are you brain-dead?|
{5696}{5764}I'm not going in there|with two Jedi.|
{5804}{5838}Send a droid.|
{5969}{6014}Is it in their nature|to make us wait this long?|
{6017}{6072}No. I sense|an unusual amount of fear...|
{6075}{6126}for something as trivial|as this trade dispute.|
{6388}{6433}<i>What is it?</i>|
{6436}{6500}This scheme of yours has failed,|Lord Sidious.|
{6503}{6588}The blockade is finished.|We dare not go against these Jedi.|
{6591}{6706}<i>Viceroy, I don't want|this stunted slime in my sight again.</i>|
{6739}{6836}<i>This turn of events is unfortunate.|We must accelerate our plans.</i>|
{6839}{6900}<i>Begin landing your troops.</i>|
{6903}{6992}My lord, is that legal?|
{6995}{7050}<i>I will make it legal.</i>|
{7053}{7108}And the Jedi?|
{7111}{7171}<i>The chancellor should never have|brought them into this.</i>|
{7174}{7216}<i>Kill them immediately.</i>|
{7219}{7322}Yes, my lord.|As you wish.|
{7367}{7410}Captain, look!|
{7437}{7470}Shields--|
{7554}{7599}Sorry.|
{7641}{7686}Dioxis.|
{7803}{7865}<i>They must be dead by now.</i>|
{7868}{7932}<i>Destroy what's left of them.</i>|
{8127}{8184}Oh! Excuse me.|
{8187}{8258}-Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.|-Roger, roger.|
{8281}{8321}Uh-oh. Blast them.|
{8459}{8496}What is going on down there?|
{8499}{8546}We lost the transmission, sir.|
{8654}{8726}Have you ever encountered|a Jedi knight before, sir?|
{8729}{8800}Well, no, but I don't--|Seal off the bridge.|
{8803}{8868}- Yes, sir.|- That won't be enough, sir.|
{8871}{8918}I want droidekas|up here at once!|
{8921}{8982}We will not survive this.|
{9259}{9293}Close the blast doors!|
{9452}{9504}That will hold them.|
{9707}{9772}They are still coming through.|
{9775}{9821}This is impossible!|
{9929}{9997}Where are those droidekas?|
{10035}{10077}Master! Destroyers!|
{10231}{10264}They have shield generators!|
{10299}{10364}It's a standoff.|Let's go.|
{10464}{10524}They're no match for droidekas.|
{10527}{10567}Sir!|
{10570}{10634}They've gone up|the ventilation shaft.|
{10845}{10909}- Battle droids.|- It's an invasion army.|
{10951}{11015}This is an odd play|for the Trade Federation.|
{11018}{11092}We've got to warn the Naboo|and contact Chancellor Valorum.|
{11095}{11132}Let's split up.|
{11135}{11212}Stow aboard separate ships|and meet down on the planet.|
{11215}{11259}You were right|about one thing, Master.|
{11306}{11370}The negotiations were short.|
{11398}{11456}Sir, a transmission|from the planet.|
{11459}{11509}It's Queen Amidala herself.|
{11512}{11570}At last we are getting results.|
{11603}{11675}Again you come before us,|Your Highness.|
{11678}{11752}<i>You will not be so pleased when you hear|what I have to say, Viceroy.</i>|
{11755}{11844}<i>Your trade boycott|of our planet has ended.</i>|
{11847}{11908}I was not aware of such failure.|
{11911}{11976}<i>I have word that the chancellor's|ambassadors are with you now...</i>|
{11979}{12044}<i>and that you have been commanded|to reach settlement.</i>|
{12047}{12101}I know nothing|of any ambassadors.|
{12104}{12161}You must be mistaken.|
{12164}{12212}<i>Beware, Viceroy.</i>|
{12215}{12280}<i>The Federation|has gone too far this time.</i>|
{12283}{12380}We would never do anything|without the approval of the senate.|
{12383}{12443}You assume too much.|
{12446}{12479}<i>We will see.</i>|
{12518}{12614}- She's right. The senate will never--|- It's too late now.|
{12617}{12688}- Do you think she suspects an attack?|- I don't know.|
{12691}{12795}But we must move quickly to disrupt|all communications down there.|
{12927}{13017}<i>Negotiations haven't started|because the ambassadors aren't there?</i>|
{13020}{13072}<i>How could that be true?</i>|
{13075}{13179}<i>I have assurances from the chancellor|his ambassadors did arrive.</i>|
{13182}{13272}<i>It must-- handiwork--|negotiate-- ambassadors--</i>|
{13275}{13338}<i>- nobody would--|- Senator Palpatine.</i>|
{13341}{13386}What's happening?|
{13389}{13434}Check the transmission generator.|
{13437}{13553}A communications disruption|can mean only one thing: invasion.|
{13556}{13611}The Federation|would not dare go that far.|
{13614}{13705}The senate would revoke their trade|franchise, and they'd be finished.|
{13708}{13776}We must continue to rely|on negotiation.|
{13779}{13856}Negotiation?|We've lost all communications.|
{13859}{13915}And where are|the chancellor's ambassadors?|
{13947}{14006}This is a dangerous situation,|Your Highness.|
{14009}{14059}Our security volunteers|will be no match...|
{14062}{14113}against a battle-hardened|Federation army.|
{14151}{14240}I will not condone a course of action|that will lead us to war.|
{15114}{15188}<i>- Yes, Viceroy?|- Captain, we've searched the ship...</i>|
{15191}{15242}<i>and there is no trace of theJedi.</i>|
{15245}{15311}<i>They may have gotten on|one of your landing craft.</i>|
{15314}{15373}If they're down here, sir,|we'll find them.|
{15376}{15480}<i>Use caution.|TheseJedi are not to be underestimated.</i>|
{15811}{15854}- Oh, no!|- Get away! Get out of here!|
{15876}{15922}Get down!|
{16162}{16231}Was'n dat?|Hey, wait!|
{16253}{16295}Oh, mooie-mooie,|I love you.|
{16298}{16347}You almost got us killed.|Are you brainless?|
{16350}{16389}I spake.|
{16392}{16443}The ability to speak|does not make you intelligent.|
{16446}{16515}- Now, get out of here.|- No, no, mesa stay.|
{16518}{16591}Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.|Mesa your humble servant.|
{16594}{16644}- That won't be necessary.|- Oh, but it 'tis.|

{16719}{16765}- Oh, no!|- Stay down!|
{16965}{17007}You saved my again.|
{17010}{17055}- What's this?|- A local.|
{17058}{17119}Let's get out of here|before more droids show up.|
{17122}{17203}More?|"More'' did you spake?|
{17206}{17323}Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest|safest place would be Gunga City.|
{17326}{17403}Is where I grew up.|'Tis a hidden city.|
{17442}{17487}- A city?|- Uh-huh.|
{17490}{17533}Can you take us there?|
{17546}{17589}On second thought, no.|
{17592}{17652}- Not really, no.|- No?|

{27043}{27115}<i>I have the senate|bogged down in procedures.</i>|
{27118}{27224}<i>They will have no choice but|to accept your control of the system.</i>|
{27227}{27340}The queen has great faith|that the senate will side with her.|
{27343}{27414}<i>Queen Amidala is young and naive.</i>|
{27417}{27500}<i>You will find controlling her|will not be difficult.</i>|
{27503}{27548}Yes, my lord.|
{27583}{27652}You didn't tell him|about the missing Jedi.|

{29459}{29508}Head for that outcropping.|
{29511}{29557}Oh, boy.|
{30404}{30454}Viceroy, we have captured the queen.|
{30457}{30521}Ah, victory.|
{30845}{30897}Dis'n loverly.|
{31045}{31101}How will you explain this invasion|to the senate?|
{31104}{31204}The queen and I will sign a treaty that|will legitimize our occupation here.|
{31207}{31283}I have assurances|it will be ratified by the senate.|
{31286}{31369}- I will not cooperate.|- Now, now, Your Highness.|
{31372}{31471}In time, your people's suffering will|persuade you to see our point of view.|
{31503}{31549}- Commander.|- Yes, sir.|
{31552}{31591}Process them.|
{31594}{31637}Captain, take them to Camp 4.|
{31640}{31679}Roger, roger.|
{32995}{33048}We should leave the street,|Your Highness.|
{33051}{33090}Get their weapons.|
{33134}{33188}Yousa guys bombad!|
{33227}{33284}We're ambassadors|for the supreme chancellor.|
{33287}{33332}Your negotiations seemed|to have failed, Ambassador.|
{33335}{33379}The negotiations|never took place.|
{33382}{33439}It's urgent that we make contact|with the Republic.|
{33442}{33492}They've knocked out|all our communications.|
{33495}{33575}- Do you have transports?|- In the main hangar. This way.|
{33694}{33768}- There are too many of them.|- That won't be a problem.|
{33771}{33856}Your Highness, under the circumstances,|I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.|
{33859}{33932}Thank you, Ambassador,|but my place is with my people.|
{33935}{34000}- They will kill you if you stay.|- They wouldn't dare.|
{34003}{34052}They need her to sign a treaty|to make this invasion legal.|
{34055}{34092}They can't afford to kill her.|
{34095}{34146}There is something else behind all this,|Your Highness.|
{34149}{34196}There's no logic|in the Federation's move here.|
{34199}{34246}My feelings tell me|they will destroy you.|
{34249}{34306}Our only hope is for the senate|to side with us.|
{34309}{34368}Senator Palpatine|will need your help.|
{34371}{34466}Either choice presents great danger...|to us all.|
{34469}{34514}We are brave, Your Highness.|
{34517}{34595}If you are to leave,|Your Highness, it must be now.|
{34598}{34657}Then I will plead our case|to the senate.|
{34682}{34725}Be careful, Governor.|
{34939}{34989}We'll need to free those pilots.|
{35019}{35064}I'll deal with that.|
{35147}{35172}Halt.|
{35175}{35215}I'm ambassador|to the supreme chancellor.|
{35218}{35256}I'm taking these people to Coruscant.|
{35259}{35336}- Where are you taking them?|- To Coruscant.|
{35339}{35402}Coruscant?|Uh, that doesn't compute.|
{35405}{35451}Uh, wait.|Uh, you're under arrest.|
{35582}{35611}Come on. Move!|
{35740}{35763}Go!|
{36376}{36455}Now, stay here|and keep out of trouble.|
{36546}{36598}Hello, boyos.|
{36750}{36789}There's the blockade.|
{37039}{37078}The shield generator's been hit!|
{37282}{37320}How wude!|
{37560}{37598}We're losing droids fast.|
{37618}{37681}If we can't get the shield generator|fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.|
{37733}{37763}The shields are gone.|
{37958}{37990}The power's back!|
{38057}{38140}That little droid did it.|He bypassed the main power drive.|
{38143}{38205}Deflector shields up at maximum.|
{38435}{38524}There's not enough power to get us|to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.|
{38527}{38596}We'll have to land somewhere|to refuel and repair the ship.|
{38599}{38651}Here, Master.|Tatooine.|
{38654}{38694}It's small, out of the way, poor.|
{38697}{38739}The Trade Federation|have no presence there.|
{38742}{38787}How can you be sure?|
{38790}{38836}It's controlled by the Hutts.|
{38839}{38906}You can't take Her Royal Highness there.|The Hutts are gangsters.|
{38909}{38964}- If they discovered her--|- It'd be no different than landing...|
{38967}{39012}on a system controlled|by the Federation...|
{39015}{39065}except that the Hutts|aren't looking for her...|
{39068}{39118}which gives us the advantage.|
{39225}{39297}<i>And Queen Amidala,|has she signed the treaty?</i>|
{39300}{39387}She has disappeared, my lord.|
{39390}{39490}One Naboo cruiser|got past the blockade.|
{39506}{39563}<i>I want that treaty signed.</i>|
{39566}{39615}My lord...|
{39618}{39679}it's impossible to locate the ship.|
{39682}{39735}It's out of our range.|
{39738}{39792}<i>Not for a Sith.</i>|
{39806}{39851}<i>This is my apprentice...</i>|
{39854}{39900}<i>Darth Maul.</i>|
{39932}{40011}<i>He will find your lost ship.</i>|
{40115}{40170}This is getting out of hand.|
{40173}{40222}Now there are two of them.|
{40225}{40297}We should not|have made this bargain.|
{40424}{40509}An extremely well-put-together|little droid, Your Highness.|
{40512}{40581}Without a doubt, it saved the ship,|as well as our lives.|
{40584}{40664}It is to be commended.|What is its number?|
{40728}{40779}R2-D2, Your Highness.|
{40782}{40816}Thank you, R2-D2.|
{40907}{40941}Padm�.|
{40978}{41029}Clean this droid up|as best you can.|
{41032}{41079}It deserves our gratitude.|
{41122}{41159}Continue, Captain.|
{41230}{41274}Your Highness,|with your permission...|
{41277}{41343}we're heading for a remote planet|called Tatooine.|
{41346}{41426}It's in a system far beyond the reach|of the Trade Federation.|
{41429}{41491}I do not agree|with the Jedi on this.|
{41494}{41564}You must trust my judgment,|Your Highness.|
{41646}{41687}Hello.|
{41690}{41761}Sorry. Husa are yousa?|
{41789}{41823}I'm Padm�.|
{41850}{41898}Mesa Jar Jar Binks.|
{41918}{41949}You're a Gungan, aren't you?|
{42004}{42090}- How'd you end up here with us?|- My no know.|
{42093}{42181}Mesa day starten pitty okeyday|witda brisky morning munchen.|
{42184}{42251}Den boom!|Getten berry scared...|
{42254}{42333}and grabben dat Jedi, and pow--|mesa here.|
{42366}{42426}Mesa getten|berry, berry scared.|
{42577}{42651}- That's it-- Tatooine.|- There's a settlement.|
{42654}{42752}Land near the outskirts.|We don't want to attract attention.|
{43166}{43233}The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.|We'll need a new one.|
{43236}{43295}That'll complicate things.|Be wary.|
{43298}{43373}- I sense a disturbance in the Force.|- I feel it also, Master.|
{43376}{43425}Don't let them send|any transmissions.|
{43571}{43629}The sun doen murder to mesa skin.|
{43632}{43668}Wait!|
{43694}{43728}Wait.|
{43810}{43879}Her Highness commands you|to take her handmaiden with you.|
{43882}{43972}No more commands|from Her Highness today, Captain.|
{43975}{44025}The spaceport|is not going to be pleasant.|
{44028}{44079}The queen wishes it.|
{44082}{44128}She's curious about the planet.|
{44190}{44263}This is not a good idea.|Stay close to me.|
{44594}{44662}Moisture farms,|for the most part.|
{44693}{44782}Some indigenous tribes|and scavengers.|
{44785}{44830}The few spaceports like this one...|
{44833}{44888}are havens for those|that don't wish to be found.|
{44891}{44937}Like us.|
{44969}{45036}Dissen berry, berry bad.|
{45069}{45110}Icky, icky goo!|
{45422}{45480}We'll try one of the smaller dealers.|
{45617}{45662}Good day to you.|
{45702}{45735}What do you want?|
{45738}{45812}I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.|
{45815}{45912}Ah, yes! Nubian.|We have lots of that.|
{45930}{45975}Boy, get in here now!|
{45978}{46023}My droid has a readout of what I need.|
{46086}{46126}What took you so long?|
{46146}{46179}I was cleaning the fan switches.|
{46182}{46248}Watch the store.|I've got some selling to do.|
{46251}{46329}So, let me take thee out back, huh?|
{46332}{46377}We'll find what you need.|
{46437}{46478}Don't touch anything.|
{46726}{46795}- Are you an angel?|- What?|
{46798}{46887}An angel. I heard the deep space|pilots talk about them.|
{46890}{46959}They're the most beautiful|creatures in the universe.|
{46962}{47024}They live on the moons of lego,|I think.|
{47043}{47131}You're a funny little boy.|How do you know so much?|
{47134}{47226}I listen to all the traders|and star pilots who come through here.|
{47229}{47332}I'm a pilot, you know, and someday|I'm gonna fly away from this place.|
{47335}{47430}- You're a pilot?|- Mm-hmm. All my life.|
{47433}{47488}How long have you been here?|
{47491}{47587}Since I was very little.|Three, I think.|
{47590}{47655}My mom and I were sold|to Gardulla the Hutt...|
{47658}{47723}but she lost us|betting on the Podraces.|
{47726}{47769}You're a slave?|
{47772}{47871}- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.|- I'm sorry.|
{47874}{47964}I don't fully understand.|This is a strange place to me.|
{48262}{48299}- I got ya.|- Hey!|
{48302}{48344}Hit the nose.|
{48456}{48541}A T-14 hyperdrive generator.|Thee in luck.|
{48544}{48607}I'm the only one hereabouts|who has one.|
{48610}{48694}But thee might as well buy a new ship.|It would be cheaper, I think, huh.|
{48734}{48767}Saying of which...|
{48770}{48827}how's thee gonna pay|for all this, huh?|
{48830}{48879}I have 20,000 Republic dataries.|
{48882}{48926}Republic credits?|
{48929}{48999}Republic credits are no good out here.|I need something more real.|
{49002}{49077}I don't have anything else,|but credits will do fine.|
{49080}{49167}<i>- No, they won't.|- Credits will do fine.</i>|
{49170}{49214}No, they won't!|
{49217}{49317}What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,|waving your hand around like that?|
{49320}{49422}I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks|don't work on me. Only money.|
{49442}{49523}No money, no parts, no deal.|
{49526}{49635}And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,|I promise you that.|
{49800}{49902}Wouldn't have lasted long anyways|if I wasn't so good at building things.|
{49992}{50037}We're leaving.Jar Jar.|
{50100}{50161}I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.|
{50164}{50208}I was glad to meet you too.|
{50409}{50518}Outlanders.|They think we know nothing.|
{50521}{50567}They seemed nice to me.|
{50570}{50616}Clean the racks.|
{50619}{50651}Then you can go home.|
{50654}{50697}Yippee!|
{50842}{50899}<i>And you're sure there's|nothing left on board?</i>|
{50902}{50947}A few containers of supplies.|
{50950}{51023}The queen's wardrobe, maybe,|but not enough for you to barter with...|
{51026}{51082}not in the amount|you're talking about.|
{51085}{51155}All right. I'm sure|another solution will present itself.|
{51158}{51191}I'll check back later.|
{51210}{51250}Noah gain. Noah gain.|
{51253}{51321}Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!|
{51324}{51383}Wesa be wobbed un crunched.|
{51386}{51462}Not likely. We have nothing of value.|That's our problem.|
{51828}{51862}Are you going to pay for that?|
{51910}{51955}It costs seven wupiupi.|
{52082}{52114}Oops.|
{52222}{52267}Is this yours?|
{52270}{52312}Who, mesa--|
{52412}{52463}Careful, Sebulba.|
{52466}{52514}He's a big-time outlander.|
{52517}{52602}I'd hate to see you diced|before we race again.|
{52605}{52698}Next time we race, boy,|it will be the end of you.|
{52701}{52774}If you weren't a slave,|I'd squash you now.|
{52791}{52859}Yeah, it'd be a pity|if you had to pay for me.|
{52886}{52961}- Hi.|- Hi there.|
{52964}{53007}Your buddy here was|about to be turned into orange goo.|
{53010}{53055}He picked a fight with a Dug...|
{53058}{53118}an especially dangerous Dug|called Sebulba.|
{53121}{53207}Mesa haten crunchen.|Das da las ting mesa want.|
{53210}{53306}Nevertheless, the boy is right.|You were heading into trouble.|
{53319}{53354}Thanks, my young friend.|
{53409}{53454}But mesa doen nutten!|
{53658}{53720}This storm will slow them down.|
{53723}{53759}Looks pretty bad.|
{53791}{53851}<i>- Panaka.|- Receiving a message from home.</i>|
{53854}{53897}We'll be right there.|
{54051}{54103}Here, you'll like these pallies.|
{54106}{54168}- Here.|- Thank you.|
{54196}{54251}My bones are aching.|
{54254}{54363}Storm's coming up, Ani.|You better get home quick.|
{54366}{54434}- Do you have shelter?|- We'll head back to our ship.|
{54437}{54499}- Is it far?|- It's on the outskirts.|
{54502}{54559}You'll never reach|the outskirts in time.|
{54562}{54655}Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.|
{54658}{54717}Come on.|I'll take you to my place.|
{55070}{55099}Mom!|
{55102}{55191}- Mom, I'm home!|- Ah, dissen cosy.|
{55194}{55251}- These are my friends, Mom.|- Hello.|
{55254}{55339}- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.|- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?|
{55342}{55399}Your son was kind enough|to offer us shelter.|
{55402}{55449}Come on. I'll show you 3PO.|
{55684}{55762}Isn't he great?|He's not finished yet.|
{55765}{55796}He's wonderful.|
{55826}{55867}You really like him?|
{55870}{55940}He's a protocol droid|to help Mom. Watch.|
{56046}{56077}Where is everybody?|
{56080}{56108}Whoops.|
{56185}{56213}Oh, hello.|
{56216}{56295}I am C-3PO,|human cyborg relations.|
{56298}{56343}How might I serve you?|
{56346}{56413}- He's perfect.|- Oh. Perfect.|
{56416}{56501}When the storm is over, I'll show you|my racer. I'm building a Podracer.|
{56534}{56595}I'm not sure this floor|is entirely stable.|
{56598}{56675}Hello. I don't believe|we have been introduced.|
{56721}{56775}R2-D2.|A pleasure to meet you.|
{56778}{56851}I am C-3PO,|human cyborg relations.|
{56914}{56991}I beg your pardon,|but what do you mean, " naked''?|
{57031}{57109}My parts are showing?|My goodness!|
{57220}{57279}<i>The death toll is catastrophic.</i>|
{57282}{57339}<i>We must bow to their wishes.</i>|
{57342}{57391}<i>You must contact me.</i>|
{57394}{57458}It's a trick.|Send no reply.|
{57461}{57509}Send no transmissions of any kind.|
{57564}{57633}It sounds like bait|to establish a connection trace.|
{57636}{57731}<i>What if it is true,|and the people are dying?</i>|
{57734}{57793}Either way,|we're running out of time.|
{58120}{58171}Tatooine is sparsely populated.|
{58174}{58241}If the trace was correct,|I will find them quickly, Master.|
{58244}{58289}Move against the Jedi first.|
{58292}{58357}You will then have no difficulty|in taking the queen to Naboo...|
{58360}{58405}to sign the treaty.|
{58408}{58460}At last we will reveal ourselves|to the Jedi.|
{58463}{58521}At last we will have revenge.|
{58524}{58593}You have been well-trained,|my young apprentice.|
{58596}{58653}They will be no match for you.|
{58770}{58866}All slaves have a transmitter|placed inside their bodies somewhere.|
{58892}{58964}I've been working on a scanner|to try and locate mine.|
{58967}{59051}- Any attempt to escape--|- And they blow you up!|
{59073}{59111}How wude!|
{59114}{59172}I can't believe|there's still slavery in the galaxy.|
{59175}{59220}The Republic's antislavery laws--|
{59223}{59279}The Republic doesn't exist out here.|
{59282}{59334}We must survive on our own.|
{59358}{59394}Xcuse me.|
{59444}{59505}Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?|
{59508}{59551}They have Podracing|on Malastare.|
{59554}{59619}Very fast, very dangerous.|
{59638}{59683}I'm the only human who can do it.|
{59686}{59758}You must have Jedi reflexes|if you race pods.|
{59785}{59818}Don't do that again.|
{59949}{60011}You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?|
{60082}{60151}- What makes you think that?|- I saw your laser sword.|
{60154}{60223}Only Jedis carry|that kind of weapon.|
{60226}{60301}Perhaps I killed a Jedi|and took it from him.|
{60304}{60343}I don't think so.|
{60346}{60398}No one can kill a Jedi.|
{60418}{60467}I wish that were so.|
{60470}{60519}I had a dream I was a Jedi.|
{60522}{60598}I came back here|and freed all the slaves.|
{60601}{60681}- Have you come to free us?|- No, I'm afraid not.|
{60684}{60788}I think you have.|Why else would you be here?|
{60905}{60971}I can see there's|no fooling you, Anakin.|
{60974}{61046}We're on our way to Coruscant,|the central system in the Republic...|
{61049}{61097}on a very important mission.|
{61100}{61173}How did you end up out here|in the outer rim?|
{61176}{61263}Our ship was damaged, and we're|stranded here until we can repair it.|
{61293}{61370}I can help.|I can fix anything.|
{61373}{61409}I believe you can.|
{61412}{61479}But first we must acquire|the parts we need.|
{61482}{61547}Wit no-nutten mula to trade.|
{61550}{61635}These junk dealers|must have a weakness of some kind.|
{61638}{61741}Gambling. Everything here revolves|around betting on those awful races.|
{61744}{61774}Podracing.|
{61777}{61847}Greed can be a powerful ally.|
{61850}{61919}I built a racer.|It's the fastest ever.|
{61922}{61977}There's a big race tomorrow|on Boonta Eve.|
{61980}{62027}You could enter my pod.|
{62050}{62123}- Anakin, Watto won't let you.|- Watto doesn't know I've built it.|
{62126}{62171}You could make him think|it was yours...|
{62174}{62227}and get him|to let me pilot it for you.|
{62230}{62268}I don't want you to race.|It's awful.|
{62271}{62331}I die every time|Watto makes you do it.|
{62334}{62385}But, Mom, I love it.|
{62388}{62473}The prize money would more than pay|for the parts they need.|
{62476}{62531}Anakin.|
{62534}{62600}Your mother's right.|
{62603}{62677}Is there anyone friendly to the Republic|who can help us?|
{62713}{62753}No.|
{62875}{62986}Mom, you say the biggest problem in this|universe is nobody helps each other.|
{63102}{63171}I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want|to put your son in danger.|
{63174}{63220}We'll find some other way.|
{63279}{63338}There is no other way.|
{63341}{63445}I may not like it,|but he can help you.|
{63466}{63511}He was meant to help you.|
{63836}{63881}Are you sure about this?|
{63884}{63947}Trusting our fate|to a boy we hardly know?|
{63950}{63999}The queen will not approve.|
{64002}{64047}The queen doesn't need to know.|
{64074}{64113}Well, I don't approve.|
{64140}{64203}The boy tells me you want|to sponsor him in the race.|
{64206}{64245}How can you do this?|
{64248}{64327}Not on the Republic credits,|I think.|
{64330}{64382}My ship will be the entry fee.|
{64394}{64435}Not bad!|
{64438}{64509}Not bad, huh?|Nubian, huh?|
{64512}{64591}It's in good order,|except for the parts I need.|
{64594}{64654}What would the boy ride?|
{64657}{64742}He smashed up my pod in the last race.|It would take some long time to fix it.|
{64745}{64801}It wasn't my fault.|Really.|
{64804}{64843}Sebulba flashed me with his vents.|
{64846}{64927}I actually saved the pod, mostly.|
{64954}{65013}That you did.|
{65016}{65083}The boy's good.|No doubts there, huh?|
{65086}{65146}I have acquired a pod|in a game of chance.|
{65149}{65189}The fastest ever built.|
{65192}{65315}I hope you didn't kill|anyone I know for it, huh?|
{65362}{65447}So, you supply the pod|and the entry fee...|
{65450}{65483}and I supply the boy.|
{65486}{65579}We split the winnings 50-50,|I think, huh?|
{65582}{65627}If it's going to be 50-50...|
{65630}{65693}I suggest you front the cash|for the entry.|
{65696}{65745}If we win...|
{65748}{65839}you keep all the winnings,|minus the cost of the parts I need.|
{65842}{65919}And if we lose,|you keep my ship.|
{65978}{66012}Either way, you win.|
{66151}{66183}Deal!|
{66308}{66410}Your friend|is a foolish one, methinks.|
{66601}{66671}What if this plan fails, Master?|
{66674}{66739}We could be stuck here|a very long time.|
{66742}{66803}<i>Well, it's too dangerous|to call for help...</i>|
{66806}{66887}and a ship without a power supply|isn't going to get us anywhere.|
{66890}{66937}And...|
{66940}{66985}there's something about this boy.|
{67149}{67205}You should be very proud of your son.|
{67223}{67279}He gives without any thought|of reward.|
{67282}{67351}He knows nothing of greed.|
{67354}{67380}He has--|
{67404}{67449}He has special powers.|
{67492}{67521}Yes.|
{67524}{67587}He can see things|before they happen.|
{67590}{67657}That's why he appears|to have such quick reflexes.|
{67660}{67705}It's a Jedi trait.|
{67708}{67775}He deserves better|than a slave's life.|
{67778}{67859}Had he been born in the Republic,|we would have identified him early.|
{67917}{68007}The Force is unusually strong with him.|That much is clear.|
{68010}{68052}Who was his father?|
{68117}{68163}There was no father.|
{68198}{68278}I carried him,|I gave birth, I raised him.|
{68299}{68359}I can't explain what happened.|
{68399}{68442}Can you help him?|
{68445}{68490}I don't know.|
{68550}{68637}I didn't actually come here|to free slaves.|
{68952}{68997}Wow, a real astro droid!|
{69043}{69133}- How do you get so lucky?|- That isn't the half of it.|
{69136}{69207}- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.|- What?|
{69210}{69251}With this?|
{69254}{69320}You're such a joker, Ani.|
{69323}{69400}- You've been working on that for years.|- It's never gonna run.|
{69403}{69455}Come on.|Let's go and play ball.|
{69458}{69537}Keep racing, Ani.|You're gonna be bug squash.|
{69742}{69799}Keep away from|those energy binders.|
{69802}{69885}If your hand gets caught in the beam,|it's gonna go numb for hours.|
{69888}{69921}Okay.|
{70010}{70071}My tongue is fat.|
{70074}{70148}My tongue-- Wrench.|
{70151}{70215}Where is de wrench?|Oh, dare it is.|
{70322}{70359}I'm stuck.|
{70362}{70458}You know, I find that Jar Jar creature|to be a little odd.|
{70502}{70570}You don't even know|if this thing's gonna run.|
{70573}{70623}- It will.|- I think it's time we found out.|
{70626}{70679}- Here, use this power charge.|- Yes, sir!|
{70682}{70731}Come on, Kitster.|Let's move away.|
{70734}{70787}My mouth.|
{70790}{70822}Ani, I'm stuck.|
{70947}{70999}My tongue is fat.|
{71002}{71073}You're quite right.|He's very odd indeed.|
{71126}{71175}Thank you.|
{71178}{71212}Go.|
{71560}{71647}It's working!|It's working!|
{71902}{71962}Stay still, Ani.|Let me clean this cut.|
{71965}{72059}There's so many.|Do they all have a system of planets?|
{72062}{72107}Most of them.|
{72110}{72157}Has anyone been to 'em all?|
{72198}{72227}Not likely.|
{72254}{72307}I wanna be the first one|to see 'em all.|
{72336}{72393}Ani, bedtime!|
{72396}{72462}There we are.|Good as new.|
{72465}{72534}Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.|
{72537}{72619}- What are you doing?|- Checking your blood for infections.|
{72622}{72659}Go on.|
{72662}{72709}You have a big day tomorrow.|
{72712}{72757}Sleep well, Ani.|
{72823}{72871}<i>- Obi-Wan?|- Yes, Master?</i>|
{72874}{72939}I need an analysis|of this blood sample I'm sending you.|
{72942}{72983}Wait a minute.|
{73024}{73071}I need a midi-chlorian count.|
{73142}{73205}The reading is off the chart.|
{73208}{73253}Over 20,000.|
{73256}{73343}<i>Even Master Yoda doesn't have|a midi-chlorian count that high.</i>|
{73346}{73389}No Jedi has.|
{73392}{73441}What does that mean?|
{73462}{73501}I'm not sure.|
{75178}{75247}I wanna see your spaceship|the moment the race is over.|
{75250}{75292}Patience, my blue friend.|
{75295}{75349}You'll have your winnings|before the suns set.|
{75352}{75395}And we'll be far away from here.|
{75398}{75495}Not if your ship belongs to me,|I think, huh?|
{75498}{75579}I warn you, no funny business.|
{75582}{75657}- You don't think Anakin can win?|- Don't get me wrongo.|
{75660}{75719}I have great faith in the boy.|
{75722}{75773}He's a credit to your race...|
{75776}{75853}but Sebulba there|is going to win, I think.|
{75904}{75946}Oh, no!|
{76046}{76090}Why do you think that?|
{76093}{76138}He always wins!|
{76186}{76245}I am betting heavily on Sebulba.|
{76289}{76354}- I'll take that bet.|- What?|
{76372}{76452}I'll wager my new racing pod|against, say...|
{76455}{76500}the boy and his mother.|
{76503}{76592}No pod is worth two slaves,|not by a long shot.|
{76614}{76656}The boy, then.|
{76805}{76865}We'll let fate decide, huh?|
{76868}{76950}I just happen to have|a chance cube here.|
{76953}{77026}Blue, it's the boy.|
{77029}{77056}Red...|
{77090}{77129}his mother.|
{77362}{77420}You won this small toss,|outlander...|
{77423}{77474}but you won't win the race!|
{77477}{77527}So it makes little difference!|
{77762}{77880}Better stop your friend's betting|or I'll end up owning him too.|
{77970}{78030}- What'd he mean by that?|- I'll tell you later.|
{78033}{78066}Good morning.|
{78117}{78183}Oh, my.|Space travel sounds rather perilous.|
{78233}{78329}I can assure you, they will never get me|onto one of those dreadful starships.|
{78332}{78413}This is so wizard, Ani.|I'm sure you'll do it this time.|
{78416}{78442}Do what?|
{78445}{78518}Finish the race, of course.|
{78521}{78563}You've never won a race?|
{78566}{78631}Well, not exactly.|
{78634}{78682}Not even finished?|
{78685}{78744}Kitster's right.|I will this time.|
{78747}{78796}Of course you will.|
{79507}{79551}That's absolutely right.|
{79554}{79675}And a big turnout here from all corners|of the outer rim territories.|
{79678}{79765}I see the contestants are making|their way out onto the starting grid.|
{79815}{79883}<i>I see Ben Quadinaros|from the Tund System.</i>|
{80019}{80078}<i>Two-time winner Boles Roor.</i>|
{80139}{80182}<i>Sebulba!</i>|
{80432}{80506}And in the front row,|nearside pole position...|
{80509}{80557}<i>Mawhonic!</i>|
{80586}{80635}<i>A hearty hello...</i>|
{80638}{80727}<i>to Clegg Holdfast|and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!</i>|
{80799}{80871}<i>And back again,|it's the mighty Dud Bolt...</i>|
{80874}{80984}<i>with that incredible racing machine,|the Vulptereen 327.</i>|
{81064}{81119}<i>And hoping for a big win today...</i>|
{81122}{81228}<i>Ody Mandrell,|with his record-setting pit droid team.</i>|
{81345}{81423}<i>And a late entry,|young Anakin Skywalker...</i>|
{81426}{81457}<i>a local boy.</i>|
{81522}{81576}I see the flags are moving|out onto the track.|
{82061}{82098}Be safe.|
{82101}{82157}I will, Mom. I promise.|
{82545}{82609}You won't walk away from this one...|
{82612}{82666}you slave scum.|
{82669}{82747}Don't count on it, slime ball.|
{82750}{82807}You're bantha fodder!|
{82917}{82970}- You all set, Ani?|- Yep.|
{82973}{83012}Right.|
{83111}{83174}Remember, concentrate|on the moment.|
{83177}{83267}Feel, don't think.|Use your instincts.|
{83270}{83309}I will.|
{83312}{83365}May the Force be with you.|
{83580}{83628}Jabba the Hutt.|
{83873}{83979}Welcome.|
{84002}{84080}Begin the race!|
{84333}{84409}<i>Hey, looks like|they're clearing the grid.</i>|
{84438}{84483}- Is he nervous?|- He's fine.|
{84522}{84591}You Jedi are far too reckless.|The queen is not--|
{84594}{84663}The queen trusts my judgment,|young handmaiden.|
{84666}{84719}You should too.|
{84722}{84772}You assume too much.|
{84790}{84848}<i>Start your engines.</i>|
{85790}{85870}Oh, dissen gonna be messy.|Me no watch'n!|
{86350}{86381}Oh, no!|
{86516}{86595}Wait.|Little Skywalker has stalled.|
{86846}{86947}<i>It looks like Quadinaros|is having engine trouble also.</i>|
{86985}{87016}Come on, Ani!|
{87170}{87208}<i>And there goes Skywalker!</i>|
{87211}{87246}Go, Ani, go!|
{87249}{87300}<i>He will be hard-pressed|to catch up with the leaders.</i>|
{89077}{89147}<i>Looks like a few Tusken Raiders|are camped out...</i>|
{89150}{89205}<i>on the canyon dune turn.</i>|
{89474}{89563}There goes Quadinaros'|power coupling.|
{90228}{90281}Oh, no!|
{90396}{90441}Where is Master Anakin?|
{90519}{90572}Look. Here he comes.|
{90641}{90697}<i>It looks like Skywalker|is moving up in the field.</i>|
{90718}{90752}Yay! Yippee!|
{90932}{91018}He has to complete|two more circuits? Oh, dear.|
{92639}{92684}Skywalker's|spinning out of control!|
{94073}{94168}I don't care what universe you're from.|That's gotta hurt!|
{94337}{94378}Here he comes!|
{94381}{94456}<i>At the start of the third and final lap,|Sebulba's in the lead...</i>|
{94459}{94519}<i>followed closely by Skywalker!</i>|
{94522}{94543}Go, Ani!|
{95191}{95247}Skywalker's been forced|onto the service ramp!|
{95767}{95800}It's Skywalker!|
{95823}{95855}Sebulba!|
{95858}{95960}Amazing! A quick control thrust,|and he's back on course!|
{95963}{96005}Did he crash-ed?|
{96987}{97064}Skywalker's in trouble!|Sebulba takes the lead!|
{98335}{98375}He's catching Sebulba!|
{98402}{98462}Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!|
{99190}{99247}That little human being|is out of his mind!|
{99274}{99302}<i>They're side by side!</i>|
{99989}{100034}- Yippee!|- Yay!|
{100135}{100176}I can't believe it.|
