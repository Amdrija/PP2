- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

Start: 116.620
End: 118.656
Tell them we wish
to board at once.

Start: 120.100
End: 121.453
With all due respect...

Start: 121.580
End: 124.652
the ambassadors for the supreme
chancellor wish to board immediately.

Start: 124.780
End: 126.577
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

Start: 126.700
End: 129.658
<i>As you know,
our blockade is perfectly legal...</i>

Start: 129.780
End: 133.693
<i>and we'd be happy
to receive the ambassadors.</i>

Start: 155.260
End: 157.774
I'm TC-14 at your service.

Start: 157.900
End: 159.697
This way, please.

Start: 165.580
End: 168.492
We are greatly honoured
by your visit, Ambassadors.

Start: 168.620
End: 170.417
Make yourselves comfortable.

Start: 170.540
End: 172.770
My master
will be with you shortly.

Start: 176.500
End: 178.695
I have a bad feeling about this.

Start: 178.820
End: 181.698
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

Start: 181.820
End: 185.574
It's something elsewhere, elusive.

Start: 185.700
End: 187.975
Don't centre on your anxieties,
Obi-Wan.

Start: 188.100
End: 191.092
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

Start: 191.220
End: 193.939
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

Start: 194.060
End: 195.971
But not at the expense
of the moment.

Start: 196.100
End: 198.898
Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.

Start: 199.020
End: 200.851
Yes, Master.

Start: 202.980
End: 206.450
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

Start: 206.580
End: 208.616
These Federation types are cowards.

Start: 208.740
End: 211.459
The negotiations will be short.

Start: 212.300
End: 214.734
What? What did you say?

Start: 214.860
End: 217.693
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

Start: 218.420
End: 219.569
I knew it.

Start: 219.700
End: 221.850
They're here to force a settlement.

Start: 223.140
End: 226.098
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

Start: 226.220
End: 227.733
Are you brain-dead?

Start: 227.860
End: 230.579
I'm not going in there
with two Jedi.

Start: 232.180
End: 233.533
Send a droid.

Start: 238.780
End: 240.577
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

Start: 240.700
End: 242.895
No. I sense
an unusual amount of fear...

Start: 243.020
End: 245.056
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.

Start: 255.540
End: 257.337
<i>What is it?</i>

Start: 257.460
End: 260.020
This scheme of yours has failed,
Lord Sidious.

Start: 260.140
End: 263.530
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

Start: 263.660
End: 268.256
<i>Viceroy, I don't want
this stunted slime in my sight again.</i>

Start: 269.580
End: 273.459
<i>This turn of events is unfortunate.
We must accelerate our plans.</i>

Start: 273.580
End: 276.014
<i>Begin landing your troops.</i>

Start: 276.140
End: 279.689
My lord, is that legal?

Start: 279.820
End: 282.015
<i>I will make it legal.</i>

Start: 282.140
End: 284.335
And the Jedi?

Start: 284.460
End: 286.849
<i>The chancellor should never have
brought them into this.</i>

Start: 286.980
End: 288.652
<i>Kill them immediately.</i>

Start: 288.780
End: 292.898
Yes, my lord.
As you wish.

Start: 294.700
End: 296.418
Captain, look!

Start: 297.500
End: 298.819
Shields--

Start: 302.180
End: 303.977
Sorry.

Start: 305.660
End: 307.457
Dioxis.

Start: 312.140
End: 314.608
<i>They must be dead by now.</i>

Start: 314.740
End: 317.300
<i>Destroy what's left of them.</i>

Start: 325.100
End: 327.375
Oh! Excuse me.

Start: 327.500
End: 330.333
-Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
-Roger, roger.

Start: 331.260
End: 332.852
Uh-oh. Blast them.

Start: 338.380
End: 339.859
What is going on down there?

Start: 339.980
End: 341.857
We lost the transmission, sir.

Start: 346.180
End: 349.058
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

Start: 349.180
End: 352.013
Well, no, but I don't--
Seal off the bridge.

Start: 352.140
End: 354.734
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

Start: 354.860
End: 356.737
I want droidekas
up here at once!

Start: 356.860
End: 359.294
We will not survive this.

Start: 370.380
End: 371.733
Close the blast doors!

Start: 378.100
End: 380.170
That will hold them.

Start: 388.300
End: 390.894
They are still coming through.

Start: 391.020
End: 392.851
This is impossible!

Start: 397.180
End: 399.899
Where are those droidekas?

Start: 401.420
End: 403.092
Master! Destroyers!

Start: 409.260
End: 410.579
They have shield generators!

Start: 411.980
End: 414.574
It's a standoff.
Let's go.

Start: 418.580
End: 420.969
They're no match for droidekas.

Start: 421.100
End: 422.692
Sir!

Start: 422.820
End: 425.380
They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.

Start: 433.820
End: 436.380
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

Start: 438.060
End: 440.620
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.

Start: 440.740
End: 443.698
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

Start: 443.820
End: 445.299
Let's split up.

Start: 445.420
End: 448.492
Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

Start: 448.620
End: 450.372
You were right
about one thing, Master.

Start: 452.260
End: 454.820
The negotiations were short.

Start: 455.940
End: 458.249
Sir, a transmission
from the planet.

Start: 458.380
End: 460.371
It's Queen Amidala herself.

Start: 460.500
End: 462.809
At last we are getting results.

Start: 464.140
End: 467.018
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

Start: 467.140
End: 470.098
<i>You will not be so pleased when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.</i>

Start: 470.220
End: 473.769
<i>Your trade boycott
of our planet has ended.</i>

Start: 473.900
End: 476.334
I was not aware of such failure.

Start: 476.460
End: 479.054
<i>I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...</i>

Start: 479.180
End: 481.774
<i>and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.</i>

Start: 481.900
End: 484.050
I know nothing
of any ambassadors.

Start: 484.180
End: 486.455
You must be mistaken.

Start: 486.580
End: 488.491
<i>Beware, Viceroy.</i>

Start: 488.620
End: 491.214
<i>The Federation
has gone too far this time.</i>

Start: 491.340
End: 495.219
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

Start: 495.340
End: 497.729
You assume too much.

Start: 497.860
End: 499.179
<i>We will see.</i>

Start: 500.740
End: 504.574
- She's right. The senate will never--
- It's too late now.

Start: 504.700
End: 507.533
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

Start: 507.660
End: 511.812
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

Start: 517.100
End: 520.695
<i>Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?</i>

Start: 520.820
End: 522.890
<i>How could that be true?</i>

Start: 523.020
End: 527.172
<i>I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.</i>

Start: 527.300
End: 530.895
<i>It must-- handiwork--
negotiate-- ambassadors--</i>

Start: 531.020
End: 533.534
<i>- nobody would--
- Senator Palpatine.</i>

Start: 533.660
End: 535.457
What's happening?

Start: 535.580
End: 537.377
Check the transmission generator.

Start: 537.500
End: 542.130
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.

Start: 542.260
End: 544.455
The Federation
would not dare go that far.

Start: 544.580
End: 548.209
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be finished.

Start: 548.340
End: 551.059
We must continue to rely
on negotiation.

Start: 551.180
End: 554.252
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

Start: 554.380
End: 556.610
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?

Start: 557.900
End: 560.255
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.

Start: 560.380
End: 562.371
Our security volunteers
will be no match...

Start: 562.500
End: 564.536
against a battle-hardened
Federation army.

Start: 566.060
End: 569.609
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

Start: 604.580
End: 607.538
<i>- Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship...</i>

Start: 607.660
End: 609.696
<i>and there is no trace of theJedi.</i>

Start: 609.820
End: 612.459
<i>They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.</i>

Start: 612.580
End: 614.935
If they're down here, sir,
we'll find them.

Start: 615.060
End: 619.212
<i>Use caution.
TheseJedi are not to be underestimated.</i>

Start: 632.460
End: 634.178
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

Start: 635.060
End: 636.891
Get down!

Start: 646.500
End: 649.253
Was'n dat?
Hey, wait!

Start: 650.140
End: 651.812
Oh, mooie-mooie,
I love you.

Start: 651.940
End: 653.896
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

Start: 654.020
End: 655.578
I spake.

Start: 655.700
End: 657.736
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

Start: 657.860
End: 660.613
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

Start: 660.740
End: 663.652
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

Start: 663.780
End: 665.771
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it 'tis.

Start: 665.900
End: 668.653
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

Start: 668.780
End: 670.611
- Oh, no!
- Stay down!

Start: 678.620
End: 680.292
You saved my again.

Start: 680.420
End: 682.217
- What's this?
- A local.

Start: 682.340
End: 684.774
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.

Start: 684.900
End: 688.131
More?
"More'' did you spake?

Start: 688.260
End: 692.936
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

Start: 693.060
End: 696.132
Is where I grew up.
'Tis a hidden city.

Start: 697.700
End: 699.497
- A city?
- Uh-huh.

Start: 699.620
End: 701.338
Can you take us there?

Start: 701.860
End: 703.578
On second thought, no.

Start: 703.700
End: 706.089
- Not really, no.
- No?

Start: 706.220
End: 708.256
'Tis embarrassing...

Start: 708.380
End: 712.168
but my afraid
my've been banished.

Start: 712.300
End: 715.258
My forgotten. Da bosses
would do terrible tings to me.

Start: 715.380
End: 718.292
Terrible tings to me
if me goen back dare.

Start: 718.420
End: 721.298
- You hear that?
- Yah.

Start: 721.420
End: 725.015
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

Start: 725.140
End: 727.608
If they find us,
they will crush us...

Start: 727.740
End: 732.097
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

Start: 732.220
End: 733.858
Oh.

Start: 733.980
End: 735.971
Yousa point is well seen.

so don't spect a warm welcome.

Start: 752.700
End: 755.897
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.

End: 1100.010
<i>You will find controlling her
will not be difficult.</i>

Start: 1100.140
End: 1101.937
Yes, my lord.

Start: 1103.340
End: 1106.093
You didn't tell him
about the missing Jedi.

Start: 1106.220
End: 1110.532
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

Start: 1114.860
End: 1118.409
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

Start: 1118.540
End: 1121.213
Oh, maxi big, da Force.

Start: 1122.100
End: 1124.011
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

Start: 1125.340
End: 1127.615
- We're losing power.
- Oh, no!

Start: 1133.340
End: 1135.490
Wesa dyin' here.

Start: 1135.620
End: 1138.180
-Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet''?

Start: 1138.300
End: 1141.133
Monsters out dare.
Leak'n in here.

Start: 1141.260
End: 1146.015
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

Start: 1147.260
End: 1149.455
Power's back.

Start: 1149.580
End: 1151.571
Monster's back!

Start: 1159.100
End: 1160.772
Relax.

Start: 1160.900
End: 1162.299
You overdid it.

Start: 1178.380
End: 1180.336
Head for that outcropping.

Start: 1180.460
End: 1182.291
Oh, boy.

Start: 1216.180
End: 1218.171
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

Start: 1218.300
End: 1220.860
Ah, victory.

Start: 1233.820
End: 1235.890
Dis'n loverly.

Start: 1241.820
End: 1244.050
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

Start: 1244.180
End: 1248.173
The queen and I will sign a treaty that
will legitimize our occupation here.

Start: 1248.300
End: 1251.337
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

Start: 1251.460
End: 1254.770
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

Start: 1254.900
End: 1258.859
In time, your people's suffering will
persuade you to see our point of view.

Start: 1260.140
End: 1261.971
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

Start: 1262.100
End: 1263.658
Process them.

Start: 1263.780
End: 1265.498
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

Start: 1265.620
End: 1267.178
Roger, roger.

Start: 1319.820
End: 1321.936
We should leave the street,
Your Highness.

Start: 1322.060
End: 1323.618
Get their weapons.

Start: 1325.380
End: 1327.530
Yousa guys bombad!

Start: 1329.100
End: 1331.375
We're ambassadors
for the supreme chancellor.

Start: 1331.500
End: 1333.297
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

Start: 1333.420
End: 1335.172
The negotiations
never took place.

Start: 1335.300
End: 1337.575
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

Start: 1337.700
End: 1339.691
They've knocked out
all our communications.

Start: 1339.820
End: 1343.017
- Do you have transports?
- In the main hangar. This way.

Start: 1347.780
End: 1350.738
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

Start: 1350.860
End: 1354.250
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

Start: 1354.380
End: 1357.292
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

Start: 1357.420
End: 1360.014
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

Start: 1360.140
End: 1362.096
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.

Start: 1362.220
End: 1363.699
They can't afford to kill her.

Start: 1363.820
End: 1365.856
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

Start: 1365.980
End: 1367.857
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

Start: 1367.980
End: 1369.857
My feelings tell me
they will destroy you.

Start: 1369.980
End: 1372.255
Our only hope is for the senate
to side with us.

Start: 1372.380
End: 1374.735
Senator Palpatine
will need your help.

Start: 1374.860
End: 1378.648
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.

Start: 1378.780
End: 1380.577
We are brave, Your Highness.

Start: 1380.700
End: 1383.817
If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.

Start: 1383.940
End: 1386.295
Then I will plead our case
to the senate.

Start: 1387.300
End: 1389.018
Be careful, Governor.

Start: 1397.580
End: 1399.571
We'll need to free those pilots.

Start: 1400.780
End: 1402.577
I'll deal with that.

Start: 1405.900
End: 1406.889
Halt.

Start: 1407.020
End: 1408.612
I'm ambassador
to the supreme chancellor.

Start: 1408.740
End: 1410.253
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

Start: 1410.380
End: 1413.452
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

Start: 1413.580
End: 1416.094
Coruscant?
Uh, that doesn't compute.

Start: 1416.220
End: 1418.051
Uh, wait.
Uh, you're under arrest.

Start: 1423.300
End: 1424.449
Come on. Move!

Start: 1429.620
End: 1430.530
Go!

Start: 1455.060
End: 1458.211
Now, stay here
and keep out of trouble.

Start: 1461.860
End: 1463.930
Hello, boyos.

Start: 1470.020
End: 1471.578
There's the blockade.

Start: 1481.580
End: 1483.138
The shield generator's been hit!

Start: 1491.300
End: 1492.813
How wude!

Start: 1502.420
End: 1503.933
We're losing droids fast.

Start: 1504.740
End: 1507.254
If we can't get the shield generator
fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.

Start: 1509.340
End: 1510.534
The shields are gone.

Start: 1518.340
End: 1519.614
The power's back!

Start: 1522.300
End: 1525.610
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

Start: 1525.740
End: 1528.208
Deflector shields up at maximum.

Start: 1537.420
End: 1540.969
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

Start: 1541.100
End: 1543.853
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

Start: 1543.980
End: 1546.050
Here, Master.
Tatooine.

Start: 1546.180
End: 1547.772
It's small, out of the way, poor.

Start: 1547.900
End: 1549.572
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.

Start: 1549.700
End: 1551.497
How can you be sure?

Start: 1551.620
End: 1553.451
It's controlled by the Hutts.

Start: 1553.580
End: 1556.253
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

Start: 1556.380
End: 1558.575
- If they discovered her--
- It'd be no different than landing...

Start: 1558.700
End: 1560.497
on a system controlled
by the Federation...

Start: 1560.620
End: 1562.611
except that the Hutts
aren't looking for her...

Start: 1562.740
End: 1564.731
which gives us the advantage.

Start: 1569.020
End: 1571.898
<i>And Queen Amidala,
has she signed the treaty?</i>

Start: 1572.020
End: 1575.490
She has disappeared, my lord.

Start: 1575.620
End: 1579.613
One Naboo cruiser
got past the blockade.

Start: 1580.260
End: 1582.535
<i>I want that treaty signed.</i>

Start: 1582.660
End: 1584.616
My lord...

Start: 1584.740
End: 1587.174
it's impossible to locate the ship.

Start: 1587.300
End: 1589.416
It's out of our range.

Start: 1589.540
End: 1591.690
<i>Not for a Sith.</i>

Start: 1592.260
End: 1594.057
<i>This is my apprentice...</i>

Start: 1594.180
End: 1596.011
<i>Darth Maul.</i>

Start: 1597.300
End: 1600.451
<i>He will find your lost ship.</i>

Start: 1604.620
End: 1606.815
This is getting out of hand.

Start: 1606.940
End: 1608.896
Now there are two of them.

Start: 1609.020
End: 1611.898
We should not
have made this bargain.

Start: 1616.980
End: 1620.370
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

Start: 1620.500
End: 1623.253
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

Start: 1623.380
End: 1626.577
It is to be commended.
What is its number?

Start: 1629.140
End: 1631.176
R2-D2, Your Highness.

Start: 1631.300
End: 1632.653
Thank you, R2-D2.

Start: 1636.300
End: 1637.653
Padm�.

Start: 1639.140
End: 1641.176
Clean this droid up
as best you can.

Start: 1641.300
End: 1643.177
It deserves our gratitude.

Start: 1644.900
End: 1646.379
Continue, Captain.

Start: 1649.220
End: 1650.972
Your Highness,
with your permission...

Start: 1651.100
End: 1653.739
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

Start: 1653.860
End: 1657.057
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

Start: 1657.180
End: 1659.648
I do not agree
with the Jedi on this.

Start: 1659.780
End: 1662.578
You must trust my judgment,
Your Highness.

Start: 1665.860
End: 1667.498
Hello.

Start: 1667.620
End: 1670.453
Sorry. Husa are yousa?

Start: 1703.100
End: 1706.058
- That's it-- Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

Start: 1706.180
End: 1710.093
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

Start: 1726.660
End: 1729.333
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

Start: 1729.460
End: 1731.815
That'll complicate things.
Be wary.

Start: 1731.940
End: 1734.932
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.
- I feel it also, Master.

Start: 1735.060
End: 1737.016
Don't let them send
any transmissions.

Start: 1742.860
End: 1745.169

End: 1749.133
Wait.

Start: 1752.420
End: 1755.173
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

Start: 1755.300
End: 1758.895
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

Start: 1759.020
End: 1761.011
The spaceport
is not going to be pleasant.

Start: 1761.140
End: 1763.176
The queen wishes it.

Start: 1763.300
End: 1765.131
She's curious about the planet.

Start: 1767.620
End: 1770.532
This is not a good idea.
Stay close to me.

Start: 1783.780
End: 1786.499
Moisture farms,
for the most part.

Start: 1787.740
End: 1791.289
Some indigenous tribes
and scavengers.

Start: 1791.420
End: 1793.217
The few spaceports like this one...

Start: 1793.340
End: 1795.535
are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.

Start: 1795.660
End: 1797.491
Like us.

Start: 1798.780
End: 1801.453
Dissen berry, berry bad.

Start: 1802.780
End: 1804.418
Icky, icky goo!

Start: 1816.900
End: 1819.209
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

Start: 1824.700
End: 1826.497
Good day to you.

Start: 1828.100
End: 1829.419
What do you want?

Start: 1829.540
End: 1832.498
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

Start: 1832.620
End: 1836.499
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.

Start: 1837.220
End: 1839.017
Boy, get in here now!

Start: 1839.140
End: 1840.937
My droid has a readout of what I need.

Start: 1843.460
End: 1845.052
What took you so long?

Start: 1845.860
End: 1847.179
I was cleaning the fan switches.

Start: 1847.300
End: 1849.939
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

Start: 1850.060
End: 1853.177
So, let me take thee out back, huh?

Start: 1853.300
End: 1855.097
We'll find what you need.

Start: 1857.500
End: 1859.138
Don't touch anything.

Start: 1869.060
End: 1871.813
- Are you an angel?
- What?

Start: 1871.940
End: 1875.489
An angel. I heard the deep space
pilots talk about them.

Start: 1875.620
End: 1878.373
They're the most beautiful
creatures in the universe.

Start: 1878.500
End: 1880.968
They live on the moons of lego,
I think.

Start: 1881.740
End: 1885.255
You're a funny little boy.
How do you know so much?

Start: 1885.380
End: 1889.055
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.

Start: 1889.180
End: 1893.298
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

Start: 1893.420
End: 1897.208
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

Start: 1897.340
End: 1899.535
How long have you been here?

Start: 1899.660
End: 1903.494
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.

Start: 1903.620
End: 1906.214
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt...

Start: 1906.340
End: 1908.934
but she lost us
betting on the Podraces.

Start: 1909.060
End: 1910.778
You're a slave?

Start: 1910.900
End: 1914.859
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

Start: 1914.980
End: 1918.575
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

Start: 1930.500
End: 1931.979
- I got ya.
- Hey!

Start: 1932.100
End: 1933.772
Hit the nose.

Start: 1938.260
End: 1941.650
A T-14 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

Start: 1941.780
End: 1944.294
I'm the only one hereabouts
who has one.

Start: 1944.420
End: 1947.776
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think, huh.

Start: 1949.380
End: 1950.699
Saying of which...

Start: 1950.820
End: 1953.095
how's thee gonna pay
for all this, huh?

Start: 1953.220
End: 1955.176
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

Start: 1955.300
End: 1957.052
Republic credits?

Start: 1957.180
End: 1959.978
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

Start: 1960.100
End: 1963.092
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

Start: 1963.220
End: 1966.690
<i>- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.</i>

Start: 1966.820
End: 1968.572
No, they won't!

Start: 1968.700
End: 1972.693
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?

Start: 1972.820
End: 1976.893
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

Start: 1977.700
End: 1980.931
No money, no parts, no deal.

Start: 1981.060
End: 1985.417
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

Start: 1992.020
End: 1996.093
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

Start: 1999.700
End: 2001.497
We're leaving.Jar Jar.

Start: 2004.020
End: 2006.454
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

Start: 2006.580
End: 2008.332
I was glad to meet you too.

Start: 2016.380
End: 2020.737
Outlanders.
They think we know nothing.

Start: 2020.860
End: 2022.691
They seemed nice to me.

Start: 2022.820
End: 2024.651
Clean the racks.

Start: 2024.780
End: 2026.054
Then you can go home.

Start: 2026.180
End: 2027.898
Yippee!

Start: 2033.700
End: 2035.975
<i>And you're sure there's
nothing left on board?</i>

Start: 2036.100
End: 2037.897
A few containers of supplies.

Start: 2038.020
End: 2040.932
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with...

Start: 2041.060
End: 2043.290
not in the amount
you're talking about.

Start: 2043.420
End: 2046.218
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

Start: 2046.340
End: 2047.659
I'll check back later.

Start: 2048.420
End: 2050.012
Noah gain. Noah gain.

Start: 2050.140
End: 2052.859

Wesa be wobbed un crunched.

Start: 2055.460
End: 2058.497
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

Start: 2073.140
End: 2074.493
Are you going to pay for that?

Start: 2076.420
End: 2078.217
It costs seven wupiupi.

Start: 2083.300
End: 2084.574
Oops.

Start: 2088.900
End: 2090.697
Is this yours?

Start: 2090.820
End: 2092.492
Who, mesa--

Start: 2096.500
End: 2098.536
Careful, Sebulba.

Start: 2098.660
End: 2100.571
He's a big-time outlander.

Start: 2100.700
End: 2104.090
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

Start: 2104.220
End: 2107.929
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

Start: 2108.060
End: 2110.972
If you weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.

Start: 2111.660
End: 2114.379
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.

Start: 2115.460
End: 2118.452
- Hi.
- Hi there.

Start: 2118.580
End: 2120.298
Your buddy here was
about to be turned into orange goo.

Start: 2120.420
End: 2122.217
He picked a fight with a Dug...

Start: 2122.340
End: 2124.729
an especially dangerous Dug
called Sebulba.

Start: 2124.860
End: 2128.296
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

Start: 2128.420
End: 2132.254
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

Start: 2132.780
End: 2134.179
Thanks, my young friend.

Start: 2136.380
End: 2138.177
But mesa doen nutten!

Start: 2146.340
End: 2148.808
This storm will slow them down.

Start: 2148.940
End: 2150.373
Looks pretty bad.

Start: 2151.660
End: 2154.049
<i>- Panaka.
- Receiving a message from home.</i>

Start: 2154.180
End: 2155.898
We'll be right there.

Start: 2162.060
End: 2164.130
Here, you'll like these pallies.

Start: 2164.260
End: 2166.728
- Here.
- Thank you.

Start: 2167.860
End: 2170.055
My bones are aching.

Start: 2170.180
End: 2174.537
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

Start: 2174.660
End: 2177.379
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

Start: 2177.500
End: 2179.968
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

Start: 2180.100
End: 2182.375
You'll never reach
the outskirts in time.

Start: 2182.500
End: 2186.209
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

Start: 2186.340
End: 2188.695
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.

Start: 2202.820
End: 2203.969
Mom!

Start: 2204.100
End: 2207.649
- Mom, I'm home!
- Ah, dissen cosy.

Start: 2207.780
End: 2210.055
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

Start: 2210.180
End: 2213.570
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

Start: 2213.700
End: 2215.975
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

Start: 2216.100
End: 2217.977
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.

Start: 2227.380
End: 2230.497
Isn't he great?
He's not finished yet.

Start: 2230.620
End: 2231.848
He's wonderful.

Start: 2233.060
End: 2234.698
You really like him?

Start: 2234.820
End: 2237.618
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.

Start: 2241.860
End: 2243.088
Where is everybody?

Start: 2243.220
End: 2244.335
Whoops.

Start: 2247.420
End: 2248.535
Oh, hello.

Start: 2248.660
End: 2251.811
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

Start: 2251.940
End: 2253.737
How might I serve you?

Start: 2253.860
End: 2256.533
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

Start: 2256.660
End: 2260.050
When the storm is over, I'll show you
my racer. I'm building a Podracer.

Start: 2261.380
End: 2263.814
I'm not sure this floor
is entirely stable.

Start: 2263.940
End: 2267.012
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.

Start: 2268.860
End: 2271.010
R2-D2.
A pleasure to meet you.

Start: 2271.140
End: 2274.052
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

Start: 2276.580
End: 2279.652
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, " naked''?

Start: 2281.260
End: 2284.377
My parts are showing?
My goodness!

Start: 2288.820
End: 2291.175
<i>The death toll is catastrophic.</i>

Start: 2291.300
End: 2293.575
<i>We must bow to their wishes.</i>

Start: 2293.700
End: 2295.656
<i>You must contact me.</i>

Start: 2295.780
End: 2298.340
It's a trick.
Send no reply.

Start: 2298.460
End: 2300.371
Send no transmissions of any kind.

Start: 2302.580
End: 2305.333
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

Start: 2305.460
End: 2309.248
<i>What if it is true,
and the people are dying?</i>

Start: 2309.380
End: 2311.735
Either way,
we're running out of time.

Start: 2324.820
End: 2326.856
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

Start: 2326.980
End: 2329.653
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

Start: 2329.780
End: 2331.577
Move against the Jedi first.

Start: 2331.700
End: 2334.294
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo...

Start: 2334.420
End: 2336.217
to sign the treaty.

Start: 2336.340
End: 2338.410
At last we will reveal ourselves
to the Jedi.

Start: 2338.540
End: 2340.849
At last we will have revenge.

Start: 2340.980
End: 2343.733
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

Start: 2343.860
End: 2346.135
They will be no match for you.

Start: 2350.820
End: 2354.654
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

Start: 2355.700
End: 2358.578
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

Start: 2358.700
End: 2362.056
- Any attempt to escape--
- And they blow you up!

Start: 2362.940
End: 2364.453
How wude!

Start: 2364.580
End: 2366.889
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

Start: 2367.020
End: 2368.817
The Republic's antislavery laws--

Start: 2368.940
End: 2371.170
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

Start: 2371.300
End: 2373.370
We must survive on our own.

Start: 2374.340
End: 2375.773
Xcuse me.

Start: 2377.780
End: 2380.214
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

Start: 2380.340
End: 2382.058
They have Podracing
on Malastare.

Start: 2382.180
End: 2384.774
Very fast, very dangerous.

Start: 2385.540
End: 2387.337
I'm the only human who can do it.

Start: 2387.460
End: 2390.338
You must have Jedi reflexes
if you race pods.

Start: 2391.420
End: 2392.739
Don't do that again.

Start: 2397.980
End: 2400.448
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

Start: 2403.300
End: 2406.053
- What makes you think that?
- I saw your laser sword.

Start: 2406.180
End: 2408.933
Only Jedis carry
that kind of weapon.

Start: 2409.060
End: 2412.052
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

Start: 2412.180
End: 2413.738
I don't think so.

Start: 2413.860
End: 2415.930
No one can kill a Jedi.

Start: 2416.740
End: 2418.696
I wish that were so.

Start: 2418.820
End: 2420.776
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

Start: 2420.900
End: 2423.937
I came back here
and freed all the slaves.

Start: 2424.060
End: 2427.257
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

Start: 2427.380
End: 2431.532
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

Start: 2436.220
End: 2438.859
I can see there's
no fooling you, Anakin.

Start: 2438.980
End: 2441.858
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic...

Start: 2441.980
End: 2443.891
on a very important mission.

Start: 2444.020
End: 2446.932
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?

Start: 2447.060
End: 2450.530
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.

Start: 2451.740
End: 2454.812
I can help.
I can fix anything.

Start: 2454.940
End: 2456.373
I believe you can.

Start: 2456.500
End: 2459.173
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

Start: 2459.300
End: 2461.894
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

Start: 2462.020
End: 2465.410
These junk dealers
must have a weakness of some kind.

Start: 2465.540
End: 2469.658
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

Start: 2469.780
End: 2470.974
Podracing.

Start: 2471.100
End: 2473.898
Greed can be a powerful ally.

Start: 2474.020
End: 2476.773
I built a racer.
It's the fastest ever.

Start: 2476.900
End: 2479.095
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.

Start: 2479.220
End: 2481.097
You could enter my pod.

Start: 2482.020
End: 2484.932
- Anakin, Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

Start: 2485.060
End: 2486.857
You could make him think
it was yours...

Start: 2486.980
End: 2489.096
and get him
to let me pilot it for you.

Start: 2489.220
End: 2490.733
I don't want you to race.
It's awful.

Start: 2490.860
End: 2493.249
I die every time
Watto makes you do it.

Start: 2493.380
End: 2495.416
But, Mom, I love it.

Start: 2495.540
End: 2498.930
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

Start: 2499.060
End: 2501.255
Anakin.

Start: 2501.380
End: 2504.019
Your mother's right.

Start: 2504.140
End: 2507.098
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

Start: 2508.540
End: 2510.132
No.

Start: 2515.020
End: 2519.457
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

Start: 2524.100
End: 2526.853
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

Start: 2526.980
End: 2528.811
We'll find some other way.

Start: 2531.180
End: 2533.535
There is no other way.

Start: 2533.660
End: 2537.812
I may not like it,
but he can help you.

Start: 2538.660
End: 2540.457
He was meant to help you.

Start: 2553.460
End: 2555.257
Are you sure about this?

Start: 2555.380
End: 2557.894
Trusting our fate
to a boy we hardly know?

Start: 2558.020
End: 2559.976
The queen will not approve.

Start: 2560.100
End: 2561.897
The queen doesn't need to know.

Start: 2562.980
End: 2564.538
Well, I don't approve.

Start: 2565.620
End: 2568.134
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.

Start: 2568.260
End: 2569.818
How can you do this?

Start: 2569.940
End: 2573.091
Not on the Republic credits,
I think.

Start: 2573.220
End: 2575.290
My ship will be the entry fee.

Start: 2575.780
End: 2577.418
Not bad!

Start: 2577.540
End: 2580.373
Not bad, huh?
Nubian, huh?

Start: 2580.500
End: 2583.651
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

Start: 2583.780
End: 2586.169
What would the boy ride?

Start: 2586.300
End: 2589.690
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It would take some long time to fix it.

Start: 2589.820
End: 2592.050
It wasn't my fault.
Really.

Start: 2592.180
End: 2593.738
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

Start: 2593.860
End: 2597.091
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

Start: 2598.180
End: 2600.535
That you did.

Start: 2600.660
End: 2603.333
The boy's good.
No doubts there, huh?

Start: 2603.460
End: 2605.849
I have acquired a pod
in a game of chance.

Start: 2605.980
End: 2607.572
The fastest ever built.

Start: 2607.700
End: 2612.615
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

Start: 2614.500
End: 2617.890
So, you supply the pod
and the entry fee...

Start: 2618.020
End: 2619.339
and I supply the boy.

Start: 2619.460
End: 2623.169
We split the winnings 50-50,
I think, huh?

Start: 2623.300
End: 2625.097
If it's going to be 50-50...

Start: 2625.220
End: 2627.734
I suggest you front the cash
for the entry.

Start: 2627.860
End: 2629.816
If we win...

Start: 2629.940
End: 2633.569
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

Start: 2633.700
End: 2636.772
And if we lose,
you keep my ship.

Start: 2639.140
End: 2640.493
Either way, you win.

Start: 2646.060
End: 2647.334
Deal!

Start: 2652.340
End: 2656.413
Your friend
is a foolish one, methinks.

Start: 2664.060
End: 2666.858
What if this plan fails, Master?

Start: 2666.980
End: 2669.574
We could be stuck here
a very long time.

Start: 2669.700
End: 2672.134
<i>Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help...</i>

Start: 2672.260
End: 2675.491
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

Start: 2675.620
End: 2677.497
And...

Start: 2677.620
End: 2679.417
there's something about this boy.

Start: 2685.980
End: 2688.210
You should be very proud of your son.

Start: 2688.940
End: 2691.170
He gives without any thought
of reward.

Start: 2691.300
End: 2694.053
He knows nothing of greed.

Start: 2694.180
End: 2695.215
He has--

Start: 2696.180
End: 2697.977
He has special powers.

Start: 2699.700
End: 2700.849
Yes.

Start: 2700.980
End: 2703.494
He can see things
before they happen.

Start: 2703.620
End: 2706.293
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

Start: 2706.420
End: 2708.217
It's a Jedi trait.

Start: 2708.340
End: 2711.013
He deserves better
than a slave's life.

Start: 2711.140
End: 2714.371
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

Start: 2716.700
End: 2720.295
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

Start: 2720.420
End: 2722.092
Who was his father?

Start: 2724.700
End: 2726.531
There was no father.

Start: 2727.940
End: 2731.137
I carried him,
I gave birth, I raised him.

Start: 2731.980
End: 2734.369
I can't explain what happened.

Start: 2735.980
End: 2737.698
Can you help him?

Start: 2737.820
End: 2739.617
I don't know.

Start: 2742.020
End: 2745.490
I didn't actually come here
to free slaves.

Start: 2758.100
End: 2759.897
Wow, a real astro droid!

Start: 2761.740
End: 2765.335
- How do you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

Start: 2765.460
End: 2768.293
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

Start: 2768.420
End: 2770.058
With this?

Start: 2770.180
End: 2772.819
You're such a joker, Ani.

Start: 2772.940
End: 2776.012
- You've been working on that for years.
- It's never gonna run.

Start: 2776.140
End: 2778.210
Come on.
Let's go and play ball.

Start: 2778.340
End: 2781.491
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

Start: 2789.700
End: 2791.975
Keep away from
those energy binders.

Start: 2792.100
End: 2795.410
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

Start: 2795.540
End: 2796.859
Okay.

Start: 2800.420
End: 2802.854
My tongue is fat.

Start: 2802.980
End: 2805.938
My tongue-- Wrench.

Start: 2806.060
End: 2808.620
Where is de wrench?
Oh, dare it is.

Start: 2812.900
End: 2814.379
I'm stuck.

Start: 2814.500
End: 2818.334
You know, I find that Jar Jar creature
to be a little odd.

Start: 2820.100
End: 2822.819
You don't even know
if this thing's gonna run.

Start: 2822.940
End: 2824.931
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

Start: 2825.060
End: 2827.176
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

Start: 2827.300
End: 2829.256
Come on, Kitster.
Let's move away.

Start: 2829.380
End: 2831.496
My mouth.

Start: 2831.620
End: 2832.894
Ani, I'm stuck.

Start: 2837.900
End: 2839.970
My tongue is fat.

Start: 2840.100
End: 2842.933
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.

Start: 2845.060
End: 2847.016
Thank you.

Start: 2847.140
End: 2848.493
Go.

Start: 2862.420
End: 2865.890
It's working!
It's working!

Start: 2876.100
End: 2878.489
Stay still, Ani.
Let me clean this cut.

Start: 2878.620
End: 2882.374
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

Start: 2882.500
End: 2884.297
Most of them.

Start: 2884.420
End: 2886.297
Has anyone been to 'em all?

Start: 2887.940
End: 2889.089
Not likely.

Start: 2890.180
End: 2892.296
I wanna be the first one
to see 'em all.

Start: 2893.460
End: 2895.735
Ani, bedtime!

Start: 2895.860
End: 2898.499
There we are.
Good as new.

Start: 2898.620
End: 2901.373
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

Start: 2901.500
End: 2904.776
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

Start: 2904.900
End: 2906.379
Go on.

Start: 2906.500
End: 2908.377
You have a big day tomorrow.

Start: 2908.500
End: 2910.297
Sleep well, Ani.

Start: 2912.940
End: 2914.851
<i>- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, Master?</i>

Start: 2914.980
End: 2917.574
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

Start: 2917.700
End: 2919.338
Wait a minute.

Start: 2920.980
End: 2922.857
I need a midi-chlorian count.

Start: 2925.700
End: 2928.214
The reading is off the chart.

Start: 2928.340
End: 2930.137
Over 20,000.

Start: 2930.260
End: 2933.730
<i>Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.</i>

Start: 2933.860
End: 2935.578
No Jedi has.

Start: 2935.700
End: 2937.656
What does that mean?

Start: 2938.500
End: 2940.058
I'm not sure.

Start: 3007.140
End: 3009.893
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

Start: 3010.020
End: 3011.692
Patience, my blue friend.

Start: 3011.820
End: 3013.970
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.

Start: 3014.100
End: 3015.818
And we'll be far away from here.

Start: 3015.940
End: 3019.819
Not if your ship belongs to me,
I think, huh?

Start: 3019.940
End: 3023.171
I warn you, no funny business.

Start: 3023.300
End: 3026.292
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrongo.

Start: 3026.420
End: 3028.775
I have great faith in the boy.

Start: 3028.900
End: 3030.936
He's a credit to your race...

Start: 3031.060
End: 3034.132
but Sebulba there
is going to win, I think.

Start: 3036.180
End: 3037.852
Oh, no!

Start: 3041.860
End: 3043.612
Why do you think that?

Start: 3043.740
End: 3045.537
He always wins!

Start: 3047.460
End: 3049.815
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

Start: 3051.580
End: 3054.174
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

Start: 3054.900
End: 3058.097
I'll wager my new racing pod
against, say...

Start: 3058.220
End: 3060.017
the boy and his mother.

Start: 3060.140
End: 3063.689
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

Start: 3064.580
End: 3066.252
The boy, then.

Start: 3072.220
End: 3074.609
We'll let fate decide, huh?

Start: 3074.740
End: 3078.016
I just happen to have
a chance cube here.

Start: 3078.140
End: 3081.052
Blue, it's the boy.

Start: 3081.180
End: 3082.249
Red...

Start: 3083.620
End: 3085.178
his mother.

Start: 3094.500
End: 3096.809
You won this small toss,
outlander...

Start: 3096.940
End: 3098.976
but you won't win the race!

Start: 3099.100
End: 3101.091
So it makes little difference!

Start: 3110.500
End: 3115.210
Better stop your friend's betting
or I'll end up owning him too.

Start: 3118.820
End: 3121.209
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

Start: 3121.340
End: 3122.659
Good morning.

Start: 3124.700
End: 3127.339
Oh, my.
Space travel sounds rather perilous.

Start: 3129.340
End: 3133.174
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

Start: 3133.300
End: 3136.531
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

Start: 3136.660
End: 3137.695
Do what?

Start: 3137.820
End: 3140.732
Finish the race, of course.

Start: 3140.860
End: 3142.532
You've never won a race?

Start: 3142.660
End: 3145.254
Well, not exactly.

Start: 3145.380
End: 3147.291
Not even finished?

Start: 3147.420
End: 3149.775
Kitster's right.
I will this time.

Start: 3149.900
End: 3151.856
Of course you will.

Start: 3180.300
End: 3182.052
That's absolutely right.

Start: 3182.180
End: 3187.015
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.

Start: 3187.140
End: 3190.610
I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.

Start: 3192.620
End: 3195.339
<i>I see Ben Quadinaros
from the Tund System.</i>

Start: 3200.780
End: 3203.135
<i>Two-time winner Boles Roor.</i>

Start: 3205.580
End: 3207.298
<i>Sebulba!</i>

Start: 3217.300
End: 3220.258
And in the front row,
nearside pole position...

Start: 3220.380
End: 3222.291
<i>Mawhonic!</i>

Start: 3223.460
End: 3225.416
<i>A hearty hello...</i>

Start: 3225.540
End: 3229.089
<i>to Clegg Holdfast
and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!</i>

Start: 3231.980
End: 3234.858
<i>And back again,
it's the mighty Dud Bolt...</i>

Start: 3234.980
End: 3239.371
<i>with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327.</i>

Start: 3242.580
End: 3244.775
<i>And hoping for a big win today...</i>

Start: 3244.900
End: 3249.132
<i>Ody Mandrell,
with his record-setting pit droid team.</i>

Start: 3253.820
End: 3256.937
<i>And a late entry,
young Anakin Skywalker...</i>

Start: 3257.060
End: 3258.288
<i>a local boy.</i>

Start: 3260.900
End: 3263.050
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.

Start: 3282.460
End: 3283.939
Be safe.

Start: 3284.060
End: 3286.290
I will, Mom. I promise.

Start: 3301.820
End: 3304.380
You won't walk away from this one...

Start: 3304.500
End: 3306.650
you slave scum.

Start: 3306.780
End: 3309.897
Don't count on it, slime ball.

Start: 3310.020
End: 3312.295
You're bantha fodder!

Start: 3316.700
End: 3318.816
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

Start: 3318.940
End: 3320.498
Right.

Start: 3324.460
End: 3326.974
Remember, concentrate
on the moment.

Start: 3327.100
End: 3330.695
Feel, don't think.
Use your instincts.

Start: 3330.820
End: 3332.378
I will.

Start: 3332.500
End: 3334.616
May the Force be with you.

Start: 3343.220
End: 3345.131
Jabba the Hutt.

Start: 3354.940
End: 3359.172
Welcome.

Start: 3360.100
End: 3363.217
Begin the race!

Start: 3373.340
End: 3376.377
<i>Hey, looks like
they're clearing the grid.</i>

Start: 3377.540
End: 3379.337
- Is he nervous?
- He's fine.

Start: 3380.900
End: 3383.653
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not--

Start: 3383.780
End: 3386.533
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.

Start: 3386.660
End: 3388.776
You should too.

Start: 3388.900
End: 3390.891
You assume too much.

Start: 3391.620
End: 3393.929
<i>Start your engines.</i>

Start: 3431.620
End: 3434.817
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

Start: 3454.020
End: 3455.248
Oh, no!

Start: 3460.660
End: 3463.811
Wait.
Little Skywalker has stalled.

Start: 3473.860
End: 3477.899
<i>It looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.</i>

Start: 3479.420
End: 3480.648
Come on, Ani!

Start: 3486.820
End: 3488.333
<i>And there goes Skywalker!</i>

Start: 3488.460
End: 3489.859
Go, Ani, go!

Start: 3489.980
End: 3492.016
<i>He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.</i>

Start: 3563.100
End: 3565.898
<i>Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out...</i>

Start: 3566.020
End: 3568.215
<i>on the canyon dune turn.</i>

Start: 3578.980
End: 3582.529
There goes Quadinaros'
power coupling.

Start: 3609.140
End: 3611.256
Oh, no!

Start: 3615.860
End: 3617.657
Where is Master Anakin?

Start: 3620.780
End: 3622.896
Look. Here he comes.

Start: 3625.660
End: 3627.890
<i>It looks like Skywalker
is moving up in the field.</i>

Start: 3628.740
End: 3630.093
Yay! Yippee!

Start: 3637.300
End: 3640.736
He has to complete
two more circuits? Oh, dear.

Start: 3705.580
End: 3707.377
Skywalker's
spinning out of control!

Start: 3762.940
End: 3766.728
I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!

Start: 3773.500
End: 3775.138
Here he comes!

Start: 3775.260
End: 3778.252
<i>At the start of the third and final lap,
Sebulba's in the lead...</i>

Start: 3778.380
End: 3780.769
<i>followed closely by Skywalker!</i>

Start: 3780.900
End: 3781.730
Go, Ani!

Start: 3807.660
End: 3809.890
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!

Start: 3830.700
End: 3832.019
It's Skywalker!

Start: 3832.940
End: 3834.214
Sebulba!

Start: 3834.340
End: 3838.413
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

Start: 3838.540
End: 3840.212
Did he crash-ed?

Start: 3879.500
End: 3882.572
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

Start: 3933.420
End: 3935.012
He's catching Sebulba!

Start: 3936.100
End: 3938.489
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

Start: 3967.620
End: 3969.895
That little human being
is out of his mind!

Start: 3970.980
End: 3972.095
<i>They're side by side!</i>

Start: 3999.580
End: 4001.377
- Yippee!
- Yay!

Start: 4005.420
End: 4007.058
I can't believe it.

Start: 4007.180
End: 4009.011
The crowds are going nuts!
